# BlackJack Game

This is a readme file for the Blackjack github repo.

This is a simple blackjack game where a player plays against the computer and deals cards from a deck. When you deal over 21 you automatically lose and if the computer also deals over 21 they lose as well. Initially only 1 card is shown in the dealers cards whilst the other one is hidden. This is done to simulate the real world game.
